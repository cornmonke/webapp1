<h2>How to use this site </h2>
<p1> This site is a simple website which displays a pixelated image of my study room where I spent most of my time.
  Drag the mouse around and click on different items to learn more about them and what they mean to me. Enjoy!

<h2>What is this site?</h2>
<p1> This is my first (solo) website :D. It was made after I found interest in attending a hackathon
  in December 2025 (I totally got carried by my teammate). Being project 1, this website is focused on styling,
  css and html templates without delving to much into flask backend. During this project, I learned how to manipulate
  div elements, fonts, background images, template inheritance and how to customize the appearance of a webpage.</p1>

<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p1> My name is Connor. Right now I'm just a random high-school student learning to code for fun. I know that
webpages nowadays can be made with A.I, but I enjoy adding the human touch to my code and engaging my mind to come
up with creative solutions to the hurdles of web dev. Though inexperienced, I want my portfolio to be a testament
of my resilience.</p1>
